					<description><![CDATA[The medication I need is out of stock. 
Gas Relief &#124; Simethicone 125 mg &#124; Extra Strength 365 Count SoftGels
I&#039;ve never run into this issue with Wellspring. But I&#039;m not surprised, you guys have the best quality meds, best prices, best deals. I&#039;m actually surprised it hasn&#039;t happened before, now that I think about it. 
But my question is, finally, is how long will it take to get it in stock?
Thank you so much for your time and attention. I look forward to hearing from you soon. 
Hope you have wonderful day!

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you. My beautiful daughter left us just a little over 2 years ago and the grief can overwhelm me. Knowing that I am not alone in this helps me. I share about her all the time. I feel if I don&#039;t then everyone might for get her. That would be like saying she was never here. I don&#039;t know how I do the days sometimes but I do. 
Her birthday is coming up and it is difficult. I will cook her favorite meal and her cheesecake. I will celebrate her birth. She was 47 years old when she passed.]]></description>

		Comment on Things To Consider When Buying Gym Clothes by Gwenn		</title>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for your articles. I must admit this particular one was very confusing, and not terribly specific in several paragraphs. Early on, I was great with &quot;The material should have a cotton composition of between 80-90%.&quot; Which I love -- however 80% cotton is almost impossible to find in gym clothes. Except perhaps a T-shirt. Further in the article, you seem to recommend polyamides (nylon) as the lightest. I agree, however nylon is super hot in warm weather. 

The more expensive (high-end supposedly according to retailers) the yoga pant is (for example) the higher the lycra + other fabrics are contained within. I am a fitness and yoga instructor, buying moderate-to-pricey gym leggings for 30 years, and there is no cotton really to be found. Any recommendations?  I&#039;ll take &#039;em. 

I agree with finding reviews -- wish I was smart enough to check Facebook. Now, I will. 

Again, my thanks for your website and articles, and the opportunity to comment.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would like to thank you for this very objective article about the benefits of Chiropractic Care!! It is a beyond time to acknowledge the benefits.  
I want to point out that membership in the ACA is not a requirement for licensure.  This is a group similar to the American Medical Association for MD&#039;s.  There is no educational requirement for membership, doctors simply pay their dues.  
There are additional educational certifications that could be beneficial depending on a person&#039;s specific issues including: CCSP -Certified Chiropractic Sports Physician, thru the American Chiropractic Board of Sports Physicians, DACBR - Diplomate, American Chiropractic Board of Radiology, DICCP - Diplomate in Clinical Chiropractic Pediatrics.]]></description>
